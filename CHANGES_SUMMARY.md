# Credit Age Report Fix - Changes Summary

## Issue
The Credit Age Report was displaying all fields as **₹0.00** for balance and **0** for days, despite the API returning correct data.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What is a Credit Age Report?
A financial report showing:
- Outstanding invoices for a customer
- How long each invoice has been unpaid (aging)
- Balance amounts owed
- Customer contact information

### Why It Was Broken
1. **API field `balamt`** was not in the field mapping list → Balance showed ₹0.00
2. **API field `noofdays`** was not being parsed → Days showed 0
3. **API field `nettotal`** was not in the field mapping list → Backup for credit amount

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/models/customer.dart`
**Changes:**
- Added `noofdays` field to Transaction class
- Added `getInt()` helper function to parse integer values
- Updated `balanceAmount` field mapping to include `'balamt'`
- Updated `creditAmount` field mapping to include `'nettotal'`
- Added `noofdays` parsing in `fromJson()` method
- Updated `toJson()` method to include `noofdays`

**Key Code:**
```dart
final int noofdays; // Days outstanding from API

balanceAmount: getDouble(['balanceAmount', 'balance_amount', 'balance', 
                          'outstanding', 'currbalance', 'balamt']),
creditAmount: getDouble(['creditAmount', 'credit_amount', 'credit', 'debit', 
                         'amount', 'totalamt', 'nettotal']),
noofdays: getInt(['noofdays', 'no_of_days', 'days_outstanding', 'daysold']),
```

### 2. `lib/pages/credit_age_report_page.dart`
**Changes:**
- Updated days calculation to use API's `noofdays` value
- Falls back to calculated days if `noofdays` is 0

**Key Code:**
```dart
final daysOld = transaction.noofdays > 0 ? transaction.noofdays : 
                _calculateDaysOld(transaction.date);
```

### 3. `lib/services/customer_service.dart`
**Changes:**
- Added `noofdays` parameter to all mock Transaction objects
- Ensures consistency between mock and real data

### 4. `test/url_launcher_test.dart`
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive test for Credit Age Report API response
- Validates `balamt`, `noofdays`, and `totalamt` parsing
- Tests with actual API response structure

**Test Code:**
```dart
test('Transaction.fromJson handles Credit Age Report API response', () {
  final creditAgeJson = {
    'invoiceno': 'SE/25-26/1260',
    'totalamt': '23365.20',
    'balamt': '23365.00',
    'noofdays': '42',
    'pur_date': '2025-09-10',
    // ... other fields
  };
  
  final transaction = Transaction.fromJson(creditAgeJson);
  expect(transaction.balanceAmount, 23365.00);
  expect(transaction.noofdays, 42);
  expect(transaction.creditAmount, 23365.20);
});
```

## Test Results
✅ All 8 tests pass successfully:
- Transaction.fromJson handles various field names
- Transaction.fromJson handles alternative field names
- Transaction.fromJson handles date parsing
- Transaction.fromJson handles missing fields gracefully
- **Transaction.fromJson handles Credit Age Report API response** (NEW)

## Build Status
✅ Flutter analyze: No errors (36 info/warning messages are pre-existing)
✅ All tests pass
✅ Code compiles successfully

## Result
After these changes:
- ✅ Balance amounts display correctly (e.g., ₹ 23365.00)
- ✅ Days outstanding display correctly (e.g., 42 days)
- ✅ Color-coded badges work properly
- ✅ All three tabs (Statement, Credit Age, Collection) work correctly
- ✅ API data properly mapped to UI fields
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
