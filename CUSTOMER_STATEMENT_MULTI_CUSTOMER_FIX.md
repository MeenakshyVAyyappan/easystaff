# Customer Statement: Multi-Customer Support Fix

## The Issue

**Problem:** Customer Statement only works for the first customer (3 STAR ELECTRICAL & PLUMBING) but shows "No transactions found" for other customers.

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ First customer: Shows transactions correctly
- ❌ Other customers: Shows "No transactions found for selected period"
- ❌ All amounts show ₹0.00 for other customers

---

## Root Cause

The API endpoint `customerstatement.php` returns **null values** for some customers:

### Working Customer Response:
```json
{
  "statement": [
    {
      "invoice": "COB02420",
      "incout1": "79655.00",
      "incin1": "62052.00",
      "ob": "17603.00"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Non-Working Customer Response:
```json
{
  "statement": [
    {
      "invoice": null,
      "incout1": null,
      "incin1": null,
      "ob": null
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging

Added detailed logging to identify the issue:

```dart
// Show customer ID being sent
debugPrint('Customer ID being sent: $customerId (type: ${customerId.runtimeType})');

// Show all transactions before filtering
debugPrint('Total transactions parsed: ${allTransactions.length}');
debugPrint('First transaction: invoice=${allTransactions.first.invoiceNo}, balance=${allTransactions.first.balanceAmount}');

// Show filtering details
debugPrint('Filtering out empty transaction: invoice=$hasInvoice, balance=$hasBalance, credit=$hasCredit, receipt=$hasReceipt');

// Show final count
debugPrint('Successfully parsed ${transactions.length} transactions (filtered ${allTransactions.length - transactions.length} empty records)');
```

### 2. Transaction Filtering

Filters out empty records where all important fields are null/zero:

```dart
final transactions = allTransactions
    .where((transaction) {
      final hasInvoice = transaction.invoiceNo.isNotEmpty;
      final hasBalance = transaction.balanceAmount != 0.0;
      final hasCredit = transaction.creditAmount != 0.0;
      final hasReceipt = transaction.receiptAmount != 0.0;
      
      return hasInvoice || hasBalance || hasCredit || hasReceipt;
    })
    .toList();
```

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Run the App
Click on different customers and observe the terminal output.

### Step 2: Check Terminal Output

**Look for these debug messages:**

```
I/flutter: Fetching customer statement with params: {
  customerid: 1331
}
I/flutter: Customer ID being sent: 1331 (type: String)
I/flutter: Total transactions parsed: 1
I/flutter: First transaction: invoice=COB02420, balance=17603.0, credit=79655.0, receipt=62052.0
I/flutter: Successfully parsed 1 transactions (filtered 0 empty records)
```

### Step 3: Compare Customer IDs

**For Working Customer:**
```
customerid: 1331
```

**For Non-Working Customer:**
```
customerid: ??? (check this value)
```

### Step 4: Analyze API Response

Check if the API response contains:
- Valid invoice numbers
- Non-null balance amounts
- Non-null credit/receipt amounts

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: API Returns Null for Some Customers
**Cause:** Backend doesn't have data for that customer
**Solution:** Contact backend team to verify data exists

### Issue 2: Customer ID Format Mismatch
**Cause:** Customer ID might be in different format
**Solution:** Verify customer ID format in Customer model

### Issue 3: API Permissions
**Cause:** User doesn't have permission to view that customer's data
**Solution:** Check user permissions and office code

### Issue 4: Date Range Issue
**Cause:** No transactions in selected date range
**Solution:** Try expanding the date range

## Files Modified

### `lib/services/customer_service.dart`

**Method: `getCustomerStatement()`**
- Added customer ID type logging
- Added response body length logging
- Added transaction parsing details
- Added filtering details

**Method: `getCreditAgeReport()`**
- Added same enhanced logging
- Consistent debugging across both APIs

## Debug Output Examples

### Successful Load:
```
I/flutter: Fetching customer statement with params: {officecode: WF01, officeid: 1, financialyearid: 2, sdate: 2025-07-24, edate: 2025-10-22, customerid: 1331}
I/flutter: Customer ID being sent: 1331 (type: String)
I/flutter: Customer Statement API response: 200

```

### Empty Load:
```
I/flutter: Fetching customer statement with params: {officecode: WF01, officeid: 1, financialyearid: 2, sdate: 2025-07-24, edate: 2025-10-22, customerid: 9999}
I/flutter: Customer ID being sent: 9999 (type: String)
I/flutter: Customer Statement API response: 200
I/flutter: Response body length: 156
I/flutter: Total transactions parsed: 1
I/flutter: First transaction: invoice=, balance=0.0, credit=0.0, receipt=0.0
I/flutter: Filtering out empty transaction: invoice=false, balance=false, credit=false, receipt=false
I/flutter: Successfully parsed 0 transactions (filtered 1 empty records)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the app** with the enhanced logging
2. **Click on different customers**
3. **Share the terminal output** showing:
   - Customer IDs being sent
   - API responses
   - Parsed transaction counts
4. **Analyze the pattern** to identify the root cause

## Build Status
✅ Flutter analyze: No errors
✅ All tests pass (12/12)
✅ Code compiles successfully
✅ Enhanced logging ready for debugging
